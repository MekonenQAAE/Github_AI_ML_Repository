Coupon Acceptance Analysis

Brief Conclusion
Drivers heading home in the same direction as the coupon, which is five minutes away, show a higher acceptance rate compared to other scenarios. Conversely, when drivers are heading in the opposite direction and the distance increases, the acceptance rate declines.

Data Source
The data used for this analysis is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected through a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey presents various driving scenarios, including:

Destination
Current time
Weather conditions
Passenger status
Respondents were asked whether they would accept a coupon if they were the driver. Responses indicating that the user would drive there "right away" or "later before the coupon expires" were labeled as Y = 1, while responses indicating "no, I do not want the coupon" were labeled as Y = 0.

Coupon Types
The survey examined five different types of coupons:

Less expensive restaurants (under $20)
Coffee houses
Carry-out & take-away
Bars
More expensive restaurants ($20 - $50)
