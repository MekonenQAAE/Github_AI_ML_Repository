# Used Car Price Prediction

## Overview

This project provides an analysis of factors influencing used car prices using machine learning techniques. It aims to equip used car dealers with insights to optimize inventory and enhance pricing strategies.

## Key Features

- Predictive modeling of used car prices.
- Analysis of significant factors affecting pricing.
- Visualizations of model performance and insights.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **Python** (version 3.7 or higher)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

### Required Libraries

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: Launch Jupyter Notebook in your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the notebook file is located.

2. **Run the Notebook**: Open the notebook file `Mekonen_Mekonen_Practical_Application_Assignment_2.ipynb`. You can execute the cells sequentially by selecting each cell and pressing Shift + Enter.

3. **Analyze the Results**: As you run the notebook, you will see various outputs, including model training results, evaluation metrics, and visualizations. Review the sections that analyze the factors influencing used car prices.

## Key Findings

- **Influence of Manufacturer**: Brands like Ford and Chevrolet have lower average prices compared to premium brands.
- **Fuel Type Hierarchy**: Diesel and electric vehicles command higher prices.
- **Impact of Vehicle Type**: SUVs and trucks typically yield higher prices.
- **Color Preferences**: Black, white, and red vehicles are more desirable.
- **Drive Type Influence**: Four-wheel-drive vehicles generally have higher prices.
- **State Variability**: Pricing varies significantly by state, impacting sales strategies.

## Recommendations

- **Diversify Stock**: Increase inventory of diesel and electric vehicles.
- **Color Strategy**: Source black, white, and red vehicles to maximize desirability.
