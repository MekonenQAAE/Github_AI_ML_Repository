# AI & Machine Learning Projects

## Overview

This repository contains various projects and experiments in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). The goal is to provide a collection of code, data, and documentation that showcases different algorithms, models, and applications in the AI/ML domain. Each project is designed to highlight specific concepts and techniques, serving both as a learning resource and a practical reference.

## Projects

### 1. Coupon Acceptance Analysis

#### Overview
This project analyzes the acceptance rates of coupons in various driving scenarios. The analysis reveals that drivers heading home in the same direction as the coupon (which is five minutes away) show a higher acceptance rate compared to other scenarios. Conversely, when drivers are heading in the opposite direction and the distance increases, the acceptance rate declines.

#### Data Source
The data used for this analysis is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) and was collected through a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. 

#### Coupon Types
The survey examined five different types of coupons:
1. Less expensive restaurants (under $20)
2. Coffee houses
3. Carry-out & take-away
4. Bars
5. More expensive restaurants ($20 - $50)

#### Conclusion
Proximity and directionality significantly impact coupon acceptance rates among drivers.

#### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install any necessary dependencies (if applicable).
3. Run the analysis scripts to explore the data.

### 2. Used Car Price Prediction

#### Overview
This project provides an analysis of factors influencing used car prices using machine learning techniques. It aims to equip used car dealers with insights to optimize inventory and enhance pricing strategies.

#### Key Features
- Predictive modeling of used car prices.
- Analysis of significant factors affecting pricing.
- Visualizations of model performance and insights.

#### Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- **Python** (version 3.7 or higher)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

##### Required Libraries
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib

#### Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the notebook file `Mekonen_Mekonen_Practical_Application_Assignment_2.ipynb`.
3. Analyze the results, including model training outcomes and visualizations.

#### Key Findings
- Brands like Ford and Chevrolet have lower average prices compared to premium brands.
- Diesel and electric vehicles command higher prices.
- SUVs and trucks typically yield higher prices.

#### Recommendations
- Increase inventory of diesel and electric vehicles.
- Source black, white, and red vehicles to maximize desirability.

### 3. Lifestyle Factors and Lifestyle Diseases Project

#### Overview
This project investigates the relationship between common lifestyle factors—such as diet, physical activity, sleep patterns, and stress levels—and the prevalence of lifestyle diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.

#### Research Question
**How do common lifestyle factors influence the prevalence of lifestyle diseases in different demographics?**

#### Objectives
- Analyze the impact of specific lifestyle factors on the occurrence of lifestyle diseases.
- Identify trends and correlations that may inform public health initiatives.

#### Data Requirements
- Dietary habits, physical activity levels, sleep patterns, stress levels.
- Prevalence rates of lifestyle diseases and demographic information.

#### Methodology
1. Data Collection: Gather secondary data or conduct surveys.
2. Data Analysis Techniques: Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, regression analysis, data visualization.

#### Expected Outcomes
- Identification of key lifestyle factors associated with lifestyle diseases.
- Recommendations for public health interventions.

#### Conclusion
Understanding the relationship between lifestyle factors and lifestyle diseases is essential for effective public health strategies.
